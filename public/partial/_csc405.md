### Course Description

This course introduces database concepts necessary to inform the choice of a
database system for applications, and to construct and use a database.  
At least one type of database system is studied, and is used in both data 
analysis and web-app development settings.

### Prerequisites:

CSC 215 and CSC 324

### When Offered

Spring semesters.

### More Information

CSC 405 functions much like a "capstone" course in a major, drawing upon your
the programming, web-design and data analysis skills you have developed in 
earlier courses.

At the beginning of the course we learn about the basic 
principles of relational databases and study MySQL, a common language 
used to interface with relational databases.

We then apply databases in the
setting of data analysis, writing R programs to that pull data from a 
database and create numerical and graphical summaries of that data.  We also
learn to write simple [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) applications that 
permit non-technical users to perform data analysis on the Internet.

In the final portion of the course we study PostgreSQL, an object-relational
database system, and do a bit more with the Node.js environment that was
introduced in CSC 324.  We apply Node and PostgreSQL  to the construction 
of simple web apps such as online games.  These are the baby steps toward 
becoming a "full-stack" web developer!
