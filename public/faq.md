## Frequently-Asked Questions

### *Do I have to know a lot of math to do Computer Science?*

At some colleges and universities the Computer Science major involves a lot of math, but
the minor here at Georgetown does not.  The most "mathy" we are liable to get is in
the [CSC 303 Fundamentals of Data Computing](/courses/csc303.html), but even then if
you can pass any lower-level math course at Georgetown such as MAT 111 Statistics, then
you should be fine in this course.

That being said, it is true that Computer Science does develop math-like skills such as
problem-solving and critical thinking.  It is distinguished by its emphaisis on organizing
infromation and devising methods for managing complexity.  You'll find that these skills
come in handy in a wide variety of future endeavours.

### *Can I be a software developer if I minor in Computer Science?*

Honestly, no, the minor doesn't provide enough technical background for that.  On the
other hand, some of the top software developers in the world did not major in Computer
Science: instead they studied thing that interested them at the time--art, music,
literature, political science, etc.  Some of them moved gradually into programming as they
saw how much these fields now depend upon it.  Others joined technical firms in a non-technical
capacity and gradually got drawn in by the fascination of computing.

### *I'm a science major.  What will Computer Science do for me?*

A lot!  Basic computer programming, data analysis and even web design are increasingly
part of the required tool-kit of professional scientists. 
[Biologists especially](http://labstats.net/articles/why_r.html) are into
R, the first language we teach in this course.

If you are part of the Science Honors program at Georgetown then you will do a summer of
undergraduate research.  The two top "side-skills" for your research experience tend to be
statistics and computer programming.  If you take our minor then you won't be afraid
to tackel these activities in your summer of research.

### *I'm a social science major.  What will Computer Science do for me?*

See the previous question!  The social sciences are getting more and more
quantitative, too.  A background in statistics and computing is a great help in
graduate school.

### *I major in the humanities.  Why Computer Science?*

If you major in English, Religion, History or Philosophy you probably won't end up
working professionally in your major field.  You'll take jobs with organizations that
value the critical thinking skills and the broad perspective you picked up 
in your major--or you might start your own small business.

But whatever you do, it's highly likely that you'll have the opportunity to analyze data.
Or perhaps you'll want to put a website to get the word out about your business, a conference
you are organizing, or to promote the work of your favorite charity or non-profit.  This
minor will give you the skills to take on such challenges.

But you can use the minor **now**, as a student.  Everyone in the minor creates a website
and/or a blog.  If you enjoy your humanities major, why not use the blog to write about
discipline and to build community with other like-minded folks?

### I'm gonna major in math, physics or engineering, and I want to learn Computer Science to support my major.

Well, that's fine:  if you are determined to minor in Computer Science we
won't stop you.  But consider taking a minor in another field, one that will broaden your
perspective.  The Math major had plenty of computing opportunities, and you can
always take one or two extra Compute Science courses, just for fun.
