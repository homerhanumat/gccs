### More Info

This course is especially useful for someone who is interested in web design and who
can find an organization in the community that needs a website.  If you plan to design
a website then of course you should have done well in CSC 323 and CSC 324.

With the consent of the Computer Science Program Coordinator, the three-credit version
of CSC 460 can substitute in the major for a required course such as CSC 303 or
CSC 405.
