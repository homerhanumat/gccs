### Course Description

The study of basic front-end web design, including HTML and CSS and other 
design topics.  Possible topics include:  CSS frameworks, static site generators,
flat content-management systems and elementary JavaScript.  *ART 323 may be 
substituted for this course in order to fulfill requirements of the Computer 
Science minor.*

### Prerequisites:

CSC 115 or permission of the instructor.


### When Offered

ART 323 Web Design is quite similar to CSC 323, and is offered both Spring and Fall semester
by the Art Department. CSC 323 will be offered only when ART 323 is not, and
even then only if there is sufficient demand.

ART 323 automatically substitutes for CSC 323 to fulfill requirements for the
Computer Science minor.  It also serves as an alternative prerequisite for
CSC 324 Web Programming

### More Information

Most likely you'll be taking the the ART 323 version of this course.  You will
learn about HTML, the mark-up language for the content of web pages, and CSS
(Cascading Styles Sheets) the language that is used to specify the precise 
look and feel of a website.  As time permits, you'll get into a bit of Javascript
as well.  By the end of the course you should be able to customize simple static
websites, and you may get some practice with a popular Content-Management System 
such as Worpress, and be able to set up sites of your own.
