### More Info

This is your introduction ot the Compute Science minor.  You will learn the
basics of <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, the world&#39;s most popular language
for statistics and data science.  We will emphasize the
basic principles of computer programming, but we will also begin to look at
some of what the tools R provides in the way of data analysis.

All of our work will be done through an online server that can be accessed on
any computer than has a modern web browser and that is connected to the
Internet.  This means that you don&#39;t have to have your own computer in order
to succeed in this course:  you can simply use one of the many computers on campus.
Nevertheless, it is recommended that you have a computer, and a good working
laptop will be required for all subsequent Computer science courses.
