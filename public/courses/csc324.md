### Course Description

The study of one or more web programming languages, and the application of 
these languages in front-end and back-end web development.

### Prerequisites:

CSC 323.  However, as ART 323 is similar to CSC 323 and is the web design 
course that is usually offered at Georgetown, ART 323 will be accepted in 
place of CSC 323.

### When Offered

Fall semesters.

### More Information

JavaScript, the language that lives in your browser and makes websites interactive
and fun, is the primary subject of this course.  We'll spend most of the semester
learning JavaScript as a programming language, first in a "neutral" environment
provided by online tools such as [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/), but soon we'll move
to the browser environment and learn how to add exciting interactive features to
our websites.  We'll also get a taste of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), which
allows JavScript to be used as a general-purpose programming language.  Node also
puts you at the beginning of "back-end" web development, the art of building web applications
that can interact with databases to store user-data and perform actions on behalf of
users.

We'll spend some time on static-site generators.  These are great tools for quickly
developing many types of websites.  Static sites serve up quickly, and can be hosted
on the web quite cheaply---even for free!  Mostly likely we'll study the
Javascript-based generator known as [Harp](https://harpjs.com/), but we'll also
keep working with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) the engine that powers the
blog you set up in your first-year classes.  If we are lucky
we'll even get to see how a static-site generator can be attached to a
CMS (Content-Management System), so that non-technical users can edit and add content
to a site that you build for them.
