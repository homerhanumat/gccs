This is our special-topics course.  We don't expect it to be offered very often,
though, unless there happen to be an exceptionally large number of minors who 
get interested in the same subject.

It can count for 1,2 or 3 credits.  In special circumstances the three-credit version
could subsitute for a required course in the minor, but don't expect that to happen.
