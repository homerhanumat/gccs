We have two courses on tap for Fall 2017.  To begin your journey in Computer Science,
sign up for [CSC 115 Computer Programming I](/courses/csc115.html).  If you have taken
CSC 115 already, then try 
[CSC 303 Fundamentals of Data Computing](/courses/csc303.html), or ART 323 Web Design, or
even both.

Remember that ART 323 substitutes for CSC 323 Web Design.  It's important to get
this course in early.
