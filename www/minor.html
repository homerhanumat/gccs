        <h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The idea of the Computer Science minor&mdash;and note that we do
    <em>not</em> offer a major in the subject&mdash;is to supplement your major
    course of study with some ways of thinking and some practical skills that will
    serve you well, both in that major and in your future career.  We don't aim to
    turn you into a professional software developer, but rather to get you comfortable
    enough with coding that you can be the "data" person in your team or
    organization, and to be able to design, customize  and maintain websites&mdash;
    for your organization, your colleagues, groups you volunteer with, and for
    yourself.
</p>

<p>You can think of the minor as having three focal points:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Computer Programming</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Web Design</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Data Analysis/Databases</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Computer Programming</em>, the first focus, is the foundation for the
    remaining two areas.  The art of programming involves learning how
    to specify practical problems precisely and to restate them as problems
    for a machine to solve, learning one or more programming languages with
    which you can communicate procedures to a computer, and developing methods for
    organizing information and managing complexity.  In this minor you will study
    two widely general-purpose programming languages:  R, which widely used in statistics
    and data analysis, and JavaScript, a language that powers websites but which is
    becoming increasingly popular in many other domains.
</p>

<p><em>Data Analysis</em> is the art of collecting and organizing data, investigating
the data to discover patterns that support decision-making in practical situations,
and communicating the results on one's analysis to the people who need to make decisions
based upon it.  It's closely related to the field of <em>statistics</em>, but involves
much less in the way of mathematics and emphasizes the use of the computer to process
and manage data that is too large or to messy to be analyzed "by hand."  If the
data is espcially large then it may be stored in a <em>database</em>, so in the course
of our study of Data Analysis we'll learn basic concepts of database design and we'll
acquire proficiency in interacting with databases.</p>

<p>The various skills and techniques involved in the production and maintenance of
    websites make up the discipline of <em>Web Design</em>.  We'll focus mostly on
    "front-end" design", which is concerned with what the user experiences in his or
    her web browser, but we'll also touch on "back-end" web development&mdashthe
    complex computations that are done on the remote server to process information that the
    user provides.</p>

<p>Data Analysis is increasingly communicated on the Internet, so several courses in the
minor integrate both Data Analysis and Web Design.</p>


<h2>Requirements</h2>

The minor requires 18 hours in Computer Science, as follows:

<ul>
    <li>CSC 115 Computer Programming I</li>
    <li>CSC 215 Computer Programming II</li>
    <li>CSC 303 Fundamentals of Data Computing</li>
    <li>CSC 323 Web Design</li>
    <li>CSC 324 Web Programming</li>
    <li>CSC 405 Databases</li>
</ul>

There are some <strong>exceptions</strong>:

<ol>
    <li>ART 323 Web Design is currently taught every semester in the Art Deapartment
    and is quite similar to CSC 323.  Accordingly, we will only offer CSC 323 on the
    rare occasions when ART 323 is unavailable.  You may take ART 323 and expect it
    to substitute for the CSC 323 requirement.</li>
    <li>With approval of the Program Coordinator, some students may be able to do
    CSC 460, our internship course, and have it
    substitute for a required course in the minor (most likely CSC 303 or CSC 405).</li>
    <li>CSC 470 Special Topic may be offered from time to time, and in rare cases
    may substitute for a required course in the minor.</li>
</ol>

                            <h3>Course Description</h3><p>Developing algorithms to solve problems and using the computer as a means to 
implement algorithms and to automate tasks.  The course includes the study of a 
modern computer language along with the programming paradigms that it represents.
Topics include variables, control structures, data structures, objects and reuse
of code.</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>Fall and Spring.</p>
<h3>More Info</h3><p>This is your introduction ot the Compute Science minor.  You will learn the
basics of <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, the world&#39;s most popular language
for statistics and data science.  We will emphasize the
basic principles of computer programming, but we will also begin to look at
some of what the tools R provides in the way of data analysis.</p>
<p>All of our work will be done through an online server that can be accessed on
any computer than has a modern web browser and that is connected to the
Internet.  This means that you don&#39;t have to have your own computer in order
to succeed in this course:  you can simply use one of the many computers on campus.
Nevertheless, it is recommended that you have a computer, and a good working
laptop will be required for all subsequent Computer science courses.</p>

                            <h3>Course Description</h3><p>This course includes the study of the computer language and programming topics
begun in CSC 115.  It also covers tools and resources available in the larger 
“eco-system” of the language under study, and introduces students to development tools, 
including version control systems.</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>Spring semesters.</p>
<h3>More Info</h3><p>We&#39;ll use R to continue the study begun in CSC 115 study of basic progrmming 
concepts, and we&#39;ll look at some more data anlysis applications.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll also get a serious introduction to <em>version control</em>, a practice that
helps software developers keep track of changes to complex applications and that
allows programmers to collaborate with each other more effectively.  We&#39;ll learn
the version-control language known as <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, and we&#39;ll
put up our first remote software repositories on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>We will even make our first forays into web design.  The present-day R programming
environment includes a number of tools that make it easy to build R-based websites 
and blogs, and to have them hosted for free by great developer services like
<a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.  You&#39;ll design your first
sites in this course, and begin using your personal blog to write about problems
in programming or to expound on ideas from courses in your own major.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll continue to work on the online server, but you are going to have to 
learn how to install some software on other computers, so starting with 
CSC 215 a laptop in good working order will be required for every class in the
Computer Science program, except maybe for CSC 303.</p>

                            <h3>Course Description</h3><p>This course focuses on data analysis in settings where the data is so large, 
dispersed or messy that machine-processing is required to gather, clean and 
transform it into forms suitable for analysis.  We also study computer-based 
techniques for the analysis of such data, including machine data-visualization 
and machine-learning.  Finally we consider how the practice of reproducible research
and the development of interactive web-based applications can enhance 
communication of the results of data analysis.</p>
<h3>Prequisites</h3><p>MAT111 or CSC115 or PSY211 or permission of the instructor.</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>Fall semesters.</p>
<h3>More Info</h3><p>This course continues the Data Analysis thread of the minor.  The language of instruction
is R, which you studied in CSC 115, but since the course may be taken by students who
have not has CSC 115 we&#39;ll start from scratch with the elements of R that we need
for this course.  You can think of this as a gentle review.</p>
<p>What will be new to you are the special contributed R-packages, such as <code>dplyr</code>
that facilitate manipulation of data sets, and <code>ggplot2</code>, an elegant system of computer
graphics for producing graphical summaries of data.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll also become acquainted with the new field known as <em>machine learning</em>, 
in which we use the computer to build models that make predictions&mdash;sometimes astonishly
accurate ones&mdash;in practical situations.  The models we study, including classification
an regression trees, as we as random forests, bring us to the door-step of the
influential new discipline of <em>data science</em>.</p>
<p>Since Data Analysis encompasses the effective communication of what one has learned from data,
we take a closer look at <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>&mdash;first studied 
in CSC 115&mdash;as a tool for writing data analysis reports quickly and easily.  We also learn
to write simple <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> applications that permit non-technical
users to do simple data analysis interactively over the web.</p>
<p>Students majoring in Biology or one of the social sciences may find that this
course prepares them well for projects in their major that require statistics and analysis of
data.</p>

                            <h3>Course Description</h3><p>The study of basic front-end web design, including HTML and CSS and other 
design topics.  Possible topics include:  CSS frameworks, static site generators,
flat content-management systems and elementary JavaScript.  <em>ART 323 may be 
substituted for this course in order to fulfill requirements of the Computer 
Science minor.</em></p>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3><p>CSC 115 or permission of the instructor.</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>ART 323 Web Design is quite similar to CSC 323, and is offered both Spring and Fall semester
by the Art Department. CSC 323 will be offered only when ART 323 is not, and
even then only if there is sufficient demand.</p>
<p>ART 323 automatically substitutes for CSC 323 to fulfill requirements for the
Computer Science minor.  It also serves as an alternative prerequisite for
CSC 324 Web Programming</p>
<h3>More Information</h3><p>Most likely you&#39;ll be taking the the ART 323 version of this course.  You will
learn about HTML, the mark-up language for the content of web pages, and CSS
(Cascading Styles Sheets) the language that is used to specify the precise 
look and feel of a website.  As time permits, you&#39;ll get into a bit of Javascript
as well.  By the end of the course you should be able to customize simple static
websites, and you may get some practice with a popular Content-Management System 
such as Wordpress and set up a few sites of your own.</p>

these languages in front-end and back-end web development.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3><p>CSC 323.  However, as ART 323 is similar to CSC 323 and is the web design 
course that is usually offered at Georgetown, ART 323 will be accepted in 
place of CSC 323.</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>Fall semesters.</p>
<h3>More Information</h3><p>JavaScript, the language that lives in your browser and makes websites interactive
and fun, is the primary subject of this course.  We&#39;ll spend most of the semester
learning JavaScript as a programming language, first in a &quot;neutral&quot; environment
provided by online tools such as <a href="https://jsbin.com/">JS Bin</a>, but soon we&#39;ll move
to the browser environment and learn how to add exciting interactive features to
our websites.  We&#39;ll also get a taste of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, which
allows JavScript to be used as a general-purpose programming language.  Node also
puts you at the beginning of &quot;back-end&quot; web development, the art of building web applications
that can interact with databases to store user-data and perform actions on behalf of
users.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll spend some time on static-site generators.  These are great tools for quickly
developing many types of websites.  Static sites serve up quickly, and can be hosted
on the web quite cheaply---even for free!  Mostly likely we&#39;ll study the
Javascript-based generator known as <a href="https://harpjs.com/">Harp</a>, but we&#39;ll also
keep working with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> the engine that powers the
blog you set up in your first-year classes.  If we are lucky
we&#39;ll even get to see how a static-site generator can be attached to a
CMS (Content-Management System), so that non-technical users can edit and add content
to a site that you build for them.</p>

                            <h3>Course Description</h3><p>This course introduces database concepts necessary to inform the choice of a
database system for applications, and to construct and use a database.<br>At least one type of database system is studied, and is used in both data 
analysis and web-app development settings.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3><p>CSC 215 and CSC 324</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>Spring semesters.</p>
<h3>More Information</h3><p>CSC 405 functions much like a &quot;capstone&quot; course in a major, drawing upon your
the programming, web-design and data analysis skills you have developed in 
earlier courses.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the course we learn about the basic 
principles of relational databases and study MySQL, a common language 
used to interface with relational databases.</p>
<p>We then apply databases in the
setting of data analysis, writing R programs that pull data from a 
database and create numerical and graphical summaries of that data.  We also
learn to write simple <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> applications that 
permit non-technical users to perform data analysis on the Internet.</p>
<p>In the final portion of the course we study PostgreSQL, an object-relational
database system, and do a bit more with the Node.js environment that was
introduced in CSC 324.  We apply Node and PostgreSQL  to the construction 
of simple web apps such as online games.  These are the baby steps toward 
becoming a &quot;full-stack&quot; web developer!</p>

a website then of course you should have done well in CSC 323 and CSC 324.</p>
<p>With the consent of the Computer Science Program Coordinator, the three-credit version
of CSC 460 can substitute in the major for a required course such as CSC 303 or
CSC 405.</p>

                            <p>This is our special-topics course.  We don&#39;t expect it to be offered very often,
though, unless there happen to be an exceptionally large number of minors who 
get interested in the same subject.</p>
<p>It can count for 1, 2 or 3 credits.  In special circumstances the three-credit version
could subsitute for a required course in the minor, but don&#39;t expect that to happen.</p>

<h2>Possible Schedules</h2>

<p>CSC 115 is the cornerstone of the program. For someone taking it in the Fall
semester, a good sequence to complete the minor is as follows:</p>

<table class="table table-hover">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Fall</th>
        <th>Spring</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Year One</td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc115.html">CSC 115</a></td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc215.html">CSC 215</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Year Two</td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc303.html">CSC 303</a></td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc323.html">CSC 323</a> (or ART 323)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Year Three</td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc324.html">CSC 324</a></td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc405.html">CSC 405</a></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you do CSC 115 in the Spring, then your sequence could look like
this:</p>


<table class="table table-hover">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Fall</th>
        <th>Spring</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Year One</td>
        <td></td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc115.html">CSC 115</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Year Two</td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc303.html">CSC 303</a></td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc215.html">CSC 215,<br><a href="/courses/csc323.html">CSC 323</a> (or ART 323)</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Year Three</td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc324.html">CSC 324</a></td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc405.html">CSC 405</a></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>It's possible to squeeze everythig into just two years:</p>

<table class="table table-hover">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Fall</th>
        <th>Spring</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Year One</td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc115.html">CSC 115</a></td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc115.html">CSC 215</a>,<br><a href="/courses/csc323.html">CSC 323</a> (or ART 323)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Year Two</td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc303.html">CSC 303,<br><a href="/courses/csc324.html">CSC 324</a></a></td>
        <td><a href="/courses/csc405.html">CSC 215,<br><a href="/courses/csc405.html">CSC 405</a> (or ART 323)</a></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
