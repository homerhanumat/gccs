                            <h3>Course Description</h3><p>Developing algorithms to solve problems and using the computer as a means to 
implement algorithms and to automate tasks.  The course includes the study of a 
modern computer language along with the programming paradigms that it represents.
Topics include variables, control structures, data structures, objects and reuse
of code.</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>Fall and Spring</p>
<h3>More Info</h3><p>This is your introduction ot the Compute Science minor.  You will learn the
basics of <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, the world&#39;s most popular language
for statistics and data science.  We will emphasize the
basic principles of computer programming, but we will also begin to look at
some of what the tools R provides in the way of data analysis.</p>
<p>All of our work will be done through an online server that can be accessed on
any computer than has a modern web browser and that is connected to the
Internet.  This means that you don&#39;t have to have your own computer in order
to succeed in this course:  you can simply use one of the many computers on campus.
Nevertheless, it is recommended that you have a computer, and a good working
laptop will be required for all subsequent Computer science courses.</p>

                            <h3>Course Description</h3><p>This course includes the study of the computer language and programming topics
begun in CSC 115.  It also covers tools and resources available in the larger 
“eco-system” of the language under study, and introduces students to development tools, 
including version control systems.</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>Spring semesters.</p>
<h3>More Info</h3><p>We&#39;ll use R to continue the study begun in CSC 115 study of basic progrmming 
concepts, and we&#39;ll look at some more data anlysis applications.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll also get a serious introduction to <em>version control</em>, a practice that
helps software developers keep track of changes to complex applications and that
allows programmers to collaborate with each other more effectively.  We&#39;ll learn
the version-control language known as <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, and we&#39;ll
put up our first remote software repositories on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>We will even make our first forays into web design.  The present-day R programming
environment includes a number fo tools that make it easy to build R-based websites 
and blogs, and to have them hosted for free on GitHub.  You&#39;ll design your first
sites in this course, and begin using your personal blog to write about problems
in programming or to expound on ideas from courses in your own major.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll continue to work on the online server, but you are going to have to 
learn how to install some software on other computers, so starting with 
CSC 215 a laptop in good working order will be required for every class in the
Computer Science program, except maybe for CSC 303.</p>

                            <h3>Course Description</h3><p>This course focuses on data analysis in settings where the data is so 
large, dispersed or messy that machine-processing is required to gather, 
clean and transform it into forms suitable for analysis.  We also study 
computer-based techniques for the analysis of such data, including machine 
data visualization and machine-learning.  Finally we consider how the 
practice of reproducible research and the development of interactive web-based
applications can enhance communication of the results of data analysis. </p>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3><p>MAT111 or CSC115 or PSY211 or permission of the instructor.</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>Fall semesters.</p>
<h3>More Information</h3><p>You&#39;ll be a data-Ninja after you finish this course! For the sake of those who
are coming from non-programming backgrounds (MAT 111 or PSY 211), we&#39;ll begin
a gnetle, easygoing introduction to R, which you will have learned quite well
in CSC 115.  We will look more closely, though, at extensions to R that allow people
to assemble, clean and process large and messy data sets: this will be new to you.</p>
<p>We do a lot more than just make tavles and graphs, though.  We&#39;ll get a bit into
the field of machine-learning, and see how to train the computer to make astonishly
accurate predictions using such things as classification and regression trees, and
even random forests.  This brings you to the beginnings of the influential new
field known as <em>data science</em>.</p>
<p>Data analysis is just about coding, it&#39;s also about good communication of the reults
of our analses.  We will also pay attention to good writing in data analysis, and we
will get acquainted with tools like <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> that
make it possible to generate data analysis reports in a transparent way.</p>
<p>As time permits, we&#39;ll learnt to write simple 
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/">Shiny</a> applications.  These applications
can be deployed online to allow non-technical people to do some of the 
data analysis that you accomplish through programming.</p>
<p>For anyone thinking about graduate school in the sciences, social science, or who
is planning to go into business, CSC 303 may turn out to be one of the most
useful courses you take at Georgetown.</p>

                            <h3>Course Description</h3><p>The study of basic front-end web design, including HTML and CSS and other 
design topics.  Possible topics include:  CSS frameworks, static site generators,
flat content-management systems and elementary JavaScript.  <em>ART 323 may be 
substituted for this course in order to fulfill requirements of the Computer 
Science minor.</em></p>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3><p>CSC 115 or permission of the instructor.</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>ART 323 Web Design is quite similar to CSC 323, and is offered both Spring and Fall semester
by the Art Department. CSC 323 will be offered only when ART 323 is not, and
even then only if there is sufficient demand.</p>
<p>ART 323 automatically substitutes for CSC 323 to fulfill requirements for the
Computer Science minor.  It also serves as an alternative prerequisite for
CSC 324 Web Programming</p>
<h3>More Information</h3><p>Most likely you&#39;ll be taking the the ART 323 version of this course.  You will
learn about HTML, the mark-up language for the content of web pages, and CSS
(Cascading Styles Sheets) the language that is used to specify the precise 
look and feel of a website.  As time permits, you&#39;ll get into a bit of Javascript
as well.  By the end of the course you should be able to customize simple static
websites, and you may get some practice with a popular Content-Management System 
such as Worpress, and be able to set up sites of your own.</p>

                            <h3>Course Description</h3><p>The study of one or more web programming languages, and the application of 
these languages in front-end and back-end web development.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3><p>CSC 323.  However, as ART 323 is similar to CSC 323 and is the web design 
course that is usually offered at Georgetown, ART 323 will be accepted in 
place of CSC 323.</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>Fall semesters.</p>
<h3>More Information</h3><p>JavaScript, the language that lives in your browser and makes websites interactive
and fun, is the primary subject of this course.  We&#39;ll spend most of the semester
learning JavaScript as a programming language, first in a &quot;neutral&quot; environment
provided by online tools such as <a href="https://jsbin.com/">JS Bin</a>, but soon we&#39;ll move
to the browser environment and learn how to add exciting interactive features to
our websites.  We&#39;ll also get a taste of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, which
allows JavScript to be used as a general-purpose programming language.  Node also
puts at the beginning of &quot;back-end&quot; web development, the art of building web applications
that can interact with databases to store user-data and perform actions on behalf of
users.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll spend some time on static-site generators.  These are great tools for quickly
developing many types of websites.  Static sites serve up quickly, and can be hosted
on the web quite cheaply---even for free!  Mostly likely we&#39;ll study the
Javascript-based generator knonw as <a href="https://harpjs.com/">Harp</a>.  If we are lucky
we&#39;ll even get to see how a static-site generator can be attached to a
CMS (Content-Management System), so that non-technical users can edit and add content
to a site that you build for them.</p>

                            <h3>Course Description</h3><p>This course introduces database concepts necessary to inform the choice of a
database system for applications, and to construct and use a database.<br>At least one type of database system is studied, and is used in both data 
analysis and web-app development settings.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3><p>CSC 215 and CSC 324</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>Spring semesters.</p>
<h3>More Information</h3><p>CSC 405 functions much like a &quot;capstone&quot; course in a major, drawing upon your
the programming, web-design and data analysis skills you have developed in 
earlier courses.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the course we learn about the basic 
principles of relational databases and study MySQL, a common language 
used to interface with relational databases.</p>
<p>We then apply databases in the
setting of data analysis, writing R programs to that pull data from a 
database and create numerical and graphical summaries of that data.  We also
learn to write simple <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> applications that 
permit non-technical users to perform data analysis on the Internet.</p>
<p>In the final portion of the course we study PostgreSQL, an object-relational
database system, and do a bit more with the Node.js environment that was
introduced in CSC 324.  We apply Node and PostgreSQL  to the construction 
of simple web apps such as online games.  These are the baby steps toward 
becoming a &quot;full-stack&quot; web developer!</p>

<strong>1-3 credits.</strong></p>
<h3>Prequisites</h3><p>CSC115 and consent of the supervising instructor.</p>
<h3>When Offered</h3><p>As needed.</p>
<h3>More Info</h3><p>This course is especially useful for someone who is interested in web design and who
can find an organiation in the community that needs a website.  If you plan to design
a website then of course you should have done well in CSC 323 and CSC 324.</p>
<p>With the consent of the Computer Science Program Coordinator, the three-credit version
of CSC 460 can substitute in the major for a required course such as CSC 303 or
CSC 405.</p>
